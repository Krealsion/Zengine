# THE DOCUMENTATION-LINK CHECK (VOLATILE-2) -- the `doc_links` CTest entry.
#
# It answers one question: does every repo-local documentation reference this repository
# currently makes still resolve? Two populations, one rule -- and a third population under
# the external-reader rule (docs/contributing/repository-conventions.md owns both rules and
# this entry): a public repository names no path outside itself.
#
#   markdown          every relative link in a current-facing *.md, plus its #anchor
#   source comments   every repository-relative *.md path written in a first-party
#                     C/C++ comment, plus its #anchor
#   outside paths     every current-facing file of a text kind, read whole, names no path
#                     outside this repository -- not the maintainers' workspace or its
#                     private siblings, not the drive or mount it sits on, not a tool's
#                     scratch directory, not a build root beyond the tree, not a home
#
# WHY IT IS MECHANICAL. The reference itself was already the project's convention -- laws
# cite reference pages, reference pages cite tests, AGENTS cites both. What was missing is
# that a rename or a consolidation broke them silently, and the only thing standing between
# a reader and a dead pointer was an executor remembering to run a script by hand. A rule
# nobody enforces is a hope; this is the mechanism, and it rides the official lane so a red
# reaches whoever moved the file rather than whoever reads the docs six phases later.
#
# WHY CMAKE AND NOT PYTHON. Every repository-owned check here is a CMake script for the same
# reason: CMake is a dependency this project already has on every lane by construction, and
# a verifier may not depend on a tool that merely happens to be installed. The predecessor
# `tools/check-doc-links.py` could not run at all on the native Windows host this repository
# supports, which is precisely the failure mode -- a check that is absent on the lane most
# likely to break paths is not a weaker check, it is no check.
#
# WHY THE SOURCE-COMMENT HALF IS REPOSITORY-RELATIVE. A comment has no stable directory to
# be relative to: it moves when the code moves, and the same sentence gets copied between
# src/ and include/. `docs/reference/messaging.md` means the same thing from anywhere in the
# tree, so that is the accepted form and this check is what makes it one.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
#
#   * it does not require a comment to carry a reference. It verifies references that
#     exist; there is no comment-density gate and no phase-code linter here;
#   * it does not reach outside this repository. A reference that resolves above the
#     repository root is counted and skipped, never demanded -- a standalone clone has no
#     sibling to look at, and a check that passes only inside one workspace layout is a
#     check that a consumer cannot run (POP-03's reasoning, applied to documentation);
#   * it does not police frozen history. `docs/history/` describes the tree it was written
#     against, and `reference/` is the pre-Zen engine kept as a quarry; forcing either to
#     resolve here would mean editing history to satisfy a checker. They are excluded BY
#     RULE, below, and the exclusion is a written position rather than a per-file silence.
#
# A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION, ON PURPOSE -- the same decision the population contract already
# made one repository over (POP-01). Zengine is consumed as a stranger against an *installed*
# Loom package, which ships headers and libraries and no test metadata, so a check that
# needed the substrate's source tree would be a check Zengine cannot run. The rule is shared;
# the mechanism is this repository's own, and it verifies a standalone clone of it.
#
# THE SELF-TEST IS NOT OPTIONAL. A tree with no broken links and a checker that finds
# nothing produce byte-identical output, so before answering it makes the real predicate say
# NO -- a path that does not exist and an anchor that does not exist, both refused -- and say
# YES to a live document and to a heading read out of that document at runtime. Nothing in
# the self-test is a hardcoded value that could go stale into a false green.

# reworded out -- the maintainers' workspace root (which is also where its report and prompt
# directories live), the drive letter and the mount that workspace sits on, a harness's
# scratch directory, a build root beyond the tree, the maintainer's home. A leak is a
# substring wherever it sits, comment or code, so every current-facing file of a text kind
# is read whole and raw (no escape stripping: `G:\` must be found as written); binaries are
# not text and are skipped by extension. The two files that DECLARE these spellings -- this
# one, and the package witness's forbidden-word list -- are the only files allowed to carry
# them, the exemption package_vocabulary already gives its own checker; the self-test
# asserts this file carries every one of them.
#
# The spelling ending in a backslash is LAST on purpose: `\` before a `;` escapes CMake's
# list separator, so anywhere else it would weld itself to the next spelling. The self-test
# counts the list against the number written here so that a reorder is a red, not a silence.
