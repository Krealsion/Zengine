// The one translation unit that compiles the doctest framework and provides
// main() for EVERY Zengine runtime test binary. Each suite's own file includes
// "doctest.h" and defines no config macro.
//
// POP-01: a run that executed ZERO test cases is a FAILURE, not a pass.
//
// Every one of these binaries used to carry DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN,
// which means stock doctest semantics: a filter that matches nothing prints
//
//     test cases: 0 | 0 passed | 0 failed | 13 skipped
//     Status: SUCCESS!
//
// and exits 0. That was measured against `zengine-input-tests`. A
// CTest entry whose binary answers "success" to a question it never asked is a
// green with no evidence under it, and doctest 2.4.11 has no option that closes
// it -- there is no --no-tests=error equivalent anywhere in Context::parseArgs.
// So the repository's own main() closes it: the run's population is read out of
// doctest's own TestRunStats and an empty one is refused by name.
//
// This is Zengine's copy of the mechanism, not a link to Loom's. It has to be:
// this repository is consumed as a stranger against an INSTALLED Loom package,
// which ships headers and libraries and no test metadata at all. A population
// contract that needed the substrate's source tree would be a contract Zengine
// does not own. (Same reasoning as third_party/doctest.h being copied rather
// than shared.)
//
// The guard is deliberately scoped to a REAL RUN. doctest calls test_run_end
// only when `query_mode` is false -- `--count`, `--list-test-cases` and
// `--list-test-suites` report through report_query instead, and `--help`,
// `--version`, `--no-run` and `--list-reporters` return before either. Those
// are exactly the modes tests/check_population.cmake uses to take an inventory
// without running anything, so "no run happened" must stay a legitimate,
// silent, zero-exit outcome. Only a run that actually started and selected
// nothing is a lie about its own population.
