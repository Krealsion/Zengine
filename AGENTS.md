# AGENTS.md — Zengine

Docs router: **`docs/README.md`** (Timer guides/reference/laws live here;
substrate truth lives in `../Loom/docs/`, machine router
`../Loom/docs/CONTEXT.md`).

## Build / test (canonical: WSL; consumes an *installed* Loom)

```bash
# once, in ../Loom:  cmake --build build -j && cmake --install build --prefix build/_install
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$PWD/../Loom/build/_install"
cmake --build build -j"$(nproc)" && ctest --test-dir build
```

- Stranger-by-default is deliberate (`ZEN_LOOM_DEV=OFF`): an unexported-surface
  mistake must fail on every machine, not only in CI.
- Per-repo green: Zengine's lane never re-runs Loom's suite — state which
  repo's green you proved.
- Weave libraries build with `-fno-gnu-unique` (keeps `dlclose` real).
- Suites are separate binaries (`zengine-timer-tests` etc.); ctest runs them
  all, plus compile-negative targets judged on their diagnostics.

## Do not assume

- `TimedWeave` bindings reconcile immediately — they are authored, reconciled
  at activation and `TimerReady` only (TIMER-05).
- Timer handoff carries deadlines — it carries **remaining durations**
  (TIMER-03).
- `TimerReady` may precede the continuity decision (TIMER-04).
- A raw `on(const loom::Activated&)` is allowed on a `TimedWeave` — it is a
  compile-time refusal; use `on_timed_activation`.
- Loom laws stop applying here — they all do; see `../Loom/docs/laws/`.
